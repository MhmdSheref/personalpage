## Society
---
- a definable community that shares a culture
- a group who form a semi-closed social system (social sciences definition)
- a network of relationships between social entities

#### Characteristics of Society
Shared values, beliefs, cultures in a single society, yet each society has differing values, beliefs, and cultures, no two societies are the same


#### A society consists of
its people and the institutions that surround them

>in more advanced societies members often share political authority.

#### Types of Society
>1.0 Hunting Society
>2.0 Agricultural Society
>3.0 Industrial Society
>4.0 Information Society

### 1.0 Hunting Society
#### hunter-gatherer stage
people were nomadic (bands of less than 15 people) and relied on foraging, there was no material inequality

**People needed:**
- Protection
- Water
- Food
**they took shelter in:**
1. Cave Dwelling
2. Rock Shelter
3. Temporary structures of plant and animal materials

#### pastoral stage
this stage focused on domesticating and breeding animals to use for farming and resources

#### horticultural stage
this plays a role as a transition from hunting society to agricultural society, people learned to plant crops and were much less nomadic, they also started creating tools (such as hand axes)

**they took shelter in:**
1. Huts
2. Pit Houses

### 2.0 Agricultural Society
larger agricultural settlements and technology advancements (the plow) focused on food production

#### Feudal stage
In this stage, society had strict hierarchies, people at the top (king and lords) had much more power compared to those at the bottom, at this stage a great divide of economic conditions can be seen.

### 3.0 Industrial Society
This society was named after the Industrial Revolution that began in 1760
where significant developments in manufacturing were made, such as heavy-duty machinery

>It interlinked society and science

#### Characteristics of Industrial Society
 1. **The vast use of technology** and heavy machinery in large scale factories
 2. **Facilitates social change** through more educated masses and reduced gender inequality
 3. **Division of Labor** and specialization created many new jobs
 4. **Greater Emphasis on education and skill development** which facilitated progress
 5. **Heterogeneous culture** through travel led to a mix of different cultures
 6. **Income inequality** even with better economic conditions, minimized by heavy taxes


### 4.0 Information Society
in this society creation, distribution, and manipulation of information are significant economic, political, and cultural activities. it also thrives from technological advancements.
services are more likely to be sold (such as digital adviser)

#### Characteristics of Information Society
1. **Digital Technology** such as phones and computers giving access to information
2. **Information as a Commodity**, information is a resource driving economic and market trends
3. **Knowledge Economy**, Where many economic activities rely on knowledge more than labor
4. **Communication Networks** like the internet enable global real time info exchange

#### Social Implications
1. **Access to Information** can empower communities but also cause digital divide
2. **Changing Workplaces** due to the requirement of digital literacy
3. **Privacy and Security** issues are increasingly prevalent


## Definition of issue
---

2. An issue is often used to refer to a problem or matter that is in dispute or requires attention. For example, "environmental issues" or "social issues.“
3. An issue can refer to a topic or subject that is being considered, debated, or discussed, such as "the issue of healthcare reform."
#### Current social issues affecting society today
1. Climate Change (global warming)
2. Income Inequality
3. Racial Discrimination (police brutality, Black Lives Matter)
4. Mental Health Awareness

#### How to identify Social Issues
They are issues that affect many members of society, They:
1. Have consequences for many people in society.
2. Are widely recognized as an issue that needs solving.
3. Go against common beliefs and values.
4. Are solved through community action, regulation, or resources.

| Issue                          | Problem                              |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Important topic of debate      | Unwelcome situation to be dealt with |
| Implies debate                 | Does not imply debate                |
| Is often used with "deal with" | Is often used with "solve"           |
| Less commonly used             | More commonly used                   |

## Human Environmental Interaction:
---
The connection between human society and the environment, a complex system focusing on 3 main ideas:
1. Dependance
2. Adaptation
3. Modification
##### Environment:
Everything around us, living and non-living.
### Dependance
The most essential way in which this occurs is through the resources and services that the environment provides, food and water, climate, and raw materials
1. Natural Resources
     - Food Production
     - Water Supply
     - Energy Sources
2. Ecosystem Services
    - Climate Regulation (Forests and oceans absorption of CO<sub>2</sub>)
    - Water Filtration (Wetlands and forests filtering)
3. Cultural and Recreational Values Connection to Nature
    - Recreation
    - Connection to land (Native American tribes)

### Adaptation
society's attempts at adapting to the society to better utilize and protect it
1. Technological Innovations
    - Renewable Energy
2. Urban Planning
    - Green Infrastructure (Parks and green roofs manage heat, air quality and storms)
    - Disaster Preparedness (levees and flood barriers)
3. Policy and Governance
     - Regulations (protect and sustain)
     - Community Engagement

### Modification
Society modifies and changes the environment as part of our interaction with it, some examples include:
- deforestation
- agriculture
- building dams
- building homes
- waste production
- airborne pollution
___

Human Environment Interaction is split in 2 halves:
-   Positive Human Environment Interaction
- Negative Human Environment Interaction

#### Examples on Positive Human Environment Interaction
1. Urban Green Projects (Adaptation)
2. Protection Of National Parks (Adaptation)
3. Waste Reuse And Recycling (Modification)

#### Examples on Negative Human Environment Interaction
1. Deforestation (Dependance, Modification)
2. Water Usage (Dependance)
3. Energy and Natural Resources (Dependance, Modification)
4. Airborne Pollution (Modification)
5. Urban Expansion (Adaptation, Modification)

### Examples on Positive Human Environment Interaction
---

#### 1. Urban Green Projects
Urban planners globally are moving towards greener approaches, such as
- **Green roof spaces in cities**
- **Urban parks and gardens**
    to provide areas for recreation
- **Landscaping**
    (grassed areas, ponds, trees, planters), to provide shade in summer and shelter in winter
- **Street trees**
    1. Improve air quality
    2. Encourages greater biodiversity
    3. Improve the quality of the place
    4. Help toward better mental health of residents.

##### Green roof spaces in cities
###### Benefits
1. **Environmental Benefits**
    - They help reflect the solar heat and long-wave radiation off building roofs
    - They help with storm water retention
2. **Economic Benefits**
    - Increased energy efficiency for buildings by providing insulation and cooling.
    - Extended roof lifespan by protecting the roof from UV radiation and weathering.
    - Potential for urban food production through edible green roof systems
3. **Social Benefits**
    - Improved mental and physical well-being
    - Aesthetic enhancement
###### Considerations
1. **Feasibility Assessment**, check and evaluate if a green roof can be installed
2. **Design Considerations**, select a green roof system based on factors (climate, use, budget, growing medium depth, plants, drainage)
3. **Structural Reinforcement**, strengthen the roof for the new load if needed
4. **Installation**, construct the green roof (waterproofing, draining, growing medium, vegetation)
5. **Maintenance** (weeding, irrigation, periodic replanting)

#### 2. Protection Of National Parks
Nationals parks preserve natural environments, wildlife, and cultural heritage, play a role in environmental conservation,  managed by government agencies or organizations
Examples:
- Ras Muhammad
- Al-Ahrash
- El-Omayed
- Wadi El Rayan
- Abu Galum
- Wadi El-Hitan


### Examples on Negative Human Environment Interaction
---
#### 1. Deforestation
Removal of forests to use as farms or for urban use. Most common in tropical rainforests, which are forest with tall trees, warm climates and continuous rainfall; annual rainfall between 2.5 and 4.5 m, Largest being the Amazon rainforest in south America

##### Importance of Rainforests
1. Hold millions of unique plants and animals (biodiversity).
2. Help stabilize the world’s climate.
3. Protect against flood, drought, and erosion.
4. Are source for food.
5. Support tribal people.

##### Destruction of Rainforests
1. **Logging**: trees get cut for their wood often without being replaces
2. **Mining**: trees get cut to extract gold
3. **Agriculture**: poor farmers without a place to live/farm
4. **Grazing of cattle**
5. **Road construction**
##### Effects
1. Extinction of plants and animals
2. Shortage of valuable food products
3. Soils and nutrients are washed away and forest cannot grow again

#### 3. Energy And Natural Resources
Modern society depends heavily on energy for transportation and communication systems, which lead to a dramatic increase in carbon emissions over the last 100 years

#### 4 . Airborne Pollution
there are many pollutant sources such as factories, vehicles, and households, CO<sub>2</sub> isn't the only pollutant
##### Industrial Pollution
due to the processing of raw materials, which produce waste products
- iron from ore
- lumber from trees
- gasoline from crude oil
- stone from quarries

##### Effects
- Global Warming

## Global Warming
---
Increase in the earth's temperature due to greenhouse gasses (GGs), caused by burning of fossil fuels which release CO<sub>2</sub> and other GGs

Average temperatures have increased by 1°C over the last 150 years, and are expected to increase by 6 °C within the next 150 years

#### Greenhouse Gasses
The cause for global warming, they are gasses that trap the sun's heat in the atmosphere, they also absorb and re-emit infrared radiation preventing the heat from escaping, which leads to a warming effect on the surface and lower atmosphere of the earth

##### The most important GGs are:
- **H<sub>2</sub>O Water Vapor** (The most abundant)
    Influenced by temperature and other GGs
- **CO<sub>2</sub> Carbon Dioxide** (The most significant)
    Released from fossil fuels and deforestation
- **CH<sub>4</sub> Methane**
    Released from organic decay, livestock farming, coal mining, natural gas

#### Effects
- Rise in Sea Levels
- Increase in Temperature
- Damage in Habitat
- Change in Water Supply

#### Reducing Greenhouse Gases
We can reduce global warming by using less energy or using renewable sources
1. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**
2. **Use Less Heat and Air Conditioning**
by adding insulation and installing weather stripping
3. **Use compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs, they:**
    - last 10 times longer
    - use 70% less energy
    - emit 70% less heat
4. **Drive Less and Drive Smart**
    - Drive less to reduce emissions and gasoline use
    - Walking and biking for exercise
    - Drive smart by carpooling
5. **Buy Energy-Efficient Products**
    - Buy efficient tech
    - Avoid non-recyclable packaging
6. **Use Less Hot Water**
    - Buy low-flow showerheads
    - Wash your clothes with cold or warm water instead of hot
7. **Use the "Off" Switch to save electricity**
8. **Plant a Tree**
    - If you can plant a tree, start digging
    - A single tree absorbs approximately one ton of CO<sub>2</sub> during its lifetime


## Global Environmental Problem (Ozone Depletion)
---
#### Ozone layer
Region of Earth’s atmosphere that absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet radiation. It contains high concentration of ozone O<sub>3</sub> in relation to other parts of the atmosphere. Its thickness varies seasonally and geographically

90% of Earth's ozone is in lower portion of stratosphere

| Layer        | Range       |
|--------------|-------------|
| Troposphere  | 0 - 10 Km   |
| Stratosphere | 10 - 30 Km  |
| Mesosphere   | 30 - 50 Km  |
| Thermosphere | 50 - 400 Km |
| Exosphere    | > 400 Km    |

#### Ozone Depletion
Since 1970’s, the ozone hole has been increasing in size over the Antarctica
and in 2000 the ozone hole became so large such that it left Chile exposed to UV rays.

##### Causes:
1. **Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)**
    - UV strikes a CFC molecule which breaks free a Cl atom which reacts with O<sub>3</sub> to form CO and O<sub>2</sub>
    - Consists of Chlorine, Fluorine, Carbon
    - used to be utilized in fridges, air conditioners, and spray cans
    - CFC-11 assigned reference ODP value of 1
    - were phased out by 1996 in developed countries

2. **Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)**
    - Consists of H, Cl, F, and C
    - First major replacement for CFCs
    - Less destructive that CFCs, ODP from 0.01 to 1.0
    - 35% Reduction in HCFC’s by 2004 in developed countries
3. **Halons**
    - Contains: Br (bromide), Cl, F, H and C
    - Br is very effective in destroying O<sub>3</sub>
    - Used in fire extinguishers
    - Halons have ODPs ranging up to 10
    - Phased out by 1994 in developed countries
4. **Methyl Bromide**
    - Contains: Br, H and C
    - Used in pesticides
    - Methyl chloroform's ODP is 0.11
    - Phased out by most countries in the early 2000s
##### Impacts:
1. Increases penetration of UV light to earth
2. Increases risks of skin cancer and eye diseases
3. Damages agricultural crops
4. Affects development of fish, shrimp, crab and other animals
##### Efforts to reduce ozone depletion
After the discovery of ozone depletion in 1970’s
- Vienna Convention in 1985
- Montreal Convention in 1987
- These conventions led to phasing out of 95% of the ozone harmful products
- Many of the ozone-depleting substances are powerful greenhouse gases, so these efforts helped decrease global warming too

## Ezbet Eshaq’s Eco Classrooms in Fayoum, Egypt
___
Ezbet Eshaq is an agricultural village of around 1,000 people in Fayoum, Egypt.
Project status: Completed (constructed January - June 2022).

a learning space was constructed with the help of the local community in the agricultural village of Ezbet Eshaq that uses recycled materials including:
1. 9,000 reused plastic bottles filled with sand
2. Locally sourced compressed earth blocks
3. Bamboo
4. Natural clay

Doors and windows were also refurbished from old buildings and upcycled wood pallets became desks and benches for classroom furniture. Locally sourced compressed earth blocks were used as columns, local bamboo as a roof, and natural clay in plastering and floor. Broken concrete from a demolished clinic nearby and reused sandstones were materials incorporated into foundations.
The Eco Classroom is a practical experiment of building using upcycled solid waste with the help of the local community and children.

Introducing such alternative materials and techniques shifted the community’s perspective and raised their awareness of the impacts of the built environment on their health and the planet, resulting in requests for such techniques to be used in their homes.

The village children previously walked over 2Km each day along a busy road in poor condition to attend the nearest school. The project sets an affordable, context-aware, and environmental example for providing safe education for rural children.

## Population Density
---
Population density is the number of individuals living in a particular area.

### Factors that influence population density
natural resources, terrain, climate, and historical/cultural trends all contribute to shaping population density patterns, understanding these patterns is important for urban planning, resource management, and demographic analysis.
#### 1. Geography and climate
- **Availability of Natural Resources**
    water, fertile land, and access to energy sources tend to support higher population densities.
- **Topography and Accessibility**
    Flat, accessible regions are easier to develop infrastructure in, allowing for higher population concentrations. Mountainous, rugged, or remote areas have lower population densities
- **Climate and Agriculture**
    Temperate, subtropical, and tropical climates have higher population densities, while deserts, and high altitudes are lower in population density
- **Disease and Habitability**
    Areas with unhealthy climates (prone to diseases or natural disasters) usually have lower population densities
- **Cultural and Historical Factors**
    Long-standing human settlements and cultural/political centers maintain high population densities
#### 2. Economic development
Highly developed urban and industrial areas tend to have higher population densities.
#### 3. Urbanization
The growth of cities and urban centers leads to increased population density as more people migrate from rural to urban areas.

#### 4. Birth and mortality rates
Access to healthcare, education, and family planning affects birth and mortality rates. which can lead to rapid population growth and higher population densities.

#### 5. Migration patterns
Both internal and international migration flows can alter the distribution and density of population

#### 6. Government policies
Policies related to urban planning, land use, housing, and immigration can shape population density patterns.

#### 7. Social and cultural factors
Traditions, social norms, and values around family size, gender roles, and lifestyle preferences influence population dynamics.

### Impacts of Population density
1. **Resource Utilization**
    High population density can lead to overconsumption and depletion of natural resources like land, water, energy, and food
2. **Infrastructure & Services**
    Providing adequate and equitable access to these services (housing, transportation, utilities, healthcare, and education) can be challenging in high-density areas as demand increases
3. **Environment & Sustainability**
    High population density leads to increased pollution, waste generation, and carbon emissions, It can also lead to loss of green spaces, and agricultural land, impacting the natural ecosystem
4. **Public Health and Disease**
    - Increased Risk of Infectious Diseases, such as **COVID-19** where highly populated areas had higher risk
    - Environmental Hazards, increased exposure to air, water, and solid pollutants can lead to health outcomes including respiratory diseases, cancer, and birth defects
    - Mental Health, Overcrowding can lead to increased stress levels, anxiety, and depression
5. **Urban Planning**
    High density areas often have higher demand and thus higher costs and shortages for housing, they rely on apartment buildings and high-rise structures, whereas low-density areas have more single-family homes.
    Effective zoning, housing policies, and infrastructure development are crucial in densely populated areas, since its lack can lead to the growth of informal settlements (slums), a rise in homelessness, overcrowding, and bad living conditions
6. **Social & Economic Dynamic**
    job opportunities, economic productivity, and income distribution are all affected by population density leading to overcrowding, poverty, and unemployment.

### Example: Mumbai, India
**Population Density: 20,667 people per square Km, and 3rd in the world**
Mumbai (formerly Bombay) is the financial and commercial capital of India. Its high density is attributed to its small land area, large population, and growth of informal settlements.

#### Key problems in Mumbai
1. **Housing Shortage**
    lack of affordable housing led to 40% of Mumbai's population living in slums which often lack clean water, sanitation, and electricity.
2. **Overburdened Infrastructure**
    Mumbai's roads, public transportation, and utility networks are strained, leading to power and water outages as well as congestion.
3. **Environmental Degradation**
    Industrial activities contribute to severe air and water pollution in Mumbai.
4. **Public Health Concerns**
    Living in slums led to the spread of infectious diseases, such as cholera, and typhoid, and the high population led to healthcare being limited since hospitals don't have enough capacity
5. **Socioeconomic Disparities**
    The divide between the wealthy and the poor is stark, leading to social tensions and challenges social cohesion

#### Possible Solutions
Effective urban planning and governance are critical to improving the living conditions of Mumbai's densely populated city.

1. investment in affordable housing
2. upgrading of urban infrastructure
3. environmental remediation
4. social welfare programs.

### Example: Tokyo, Japan
**Population Density: over 6,000 people per square Km. One of the most densely populated**
This high population density has led to the development of innovative solutions, such as compact housing and efficient public transportation.

### Example: Australia
**Population Density: less than 3 people per square Km. One of the lowest population densities**

This low population density has its challenges, such as limited access to services in rural areas.

### Comparison

## Approaches for High Population Density
___
#### 1.Urban Planning and Zoning
- make plans that designate specific zones for high, medium, and low density development
- limit maximum building heights and population densities in certain areas
- Investing in public transportation infrastructure to reduce reliance on private vehicles.

**To implement this approach effectively:**
1. Conduct analysis of existing land use, demographic trends, and infrastructure capacities
2. Engage with stakeholders to understand community needs and priorities.
3. Establish clear criteria and thresholds for different zones
4. Integrate the density plan with other urban plans such as transportation, housing, and environmental policies
5. Regularly monitor and update the density plan to adapt to changing conditions

#### 2. Housing and Infrastructure
- Incentivizing the development of affordable & social housing to provide more housing choices.
- Upgrade basic infrastructure (water, sanitation, electricity, and waste management)

#### 3. Economic Decentralization
- Encourage establishment of industrial parks and business hubs in less populated regions through tax incentives and investment.
- Develop specialized economic clusters and industries in smaller towns and rural areas to create job opportunities
- Invest in transportation links and digital infrastructure to help connect economic centers.

#### 4. Family Planning and Education
- Improve access to family planning services (contraception, prenatal care, and reproductive health education).
- Empower women through education, economic opportunities, and participation in decision-making
- Launch awareness campaigns to educate on the benefits of smaller family sizes and family planning.

#### 5. Migration Management
- Implement policies to encourage people to settle in less populated regions (subsidies, job opportunities, and improved public services).
- Develop programs to support the economic development of rural areas.
- Collaborate with regional authorities to manage internal migration patterns.

#### 6. Sustainability and Resilience
- sustainable urban design (green infrastructure, mixed-use developments, and energy-efficient buildings)
- invest in renewable energy sources, waste management systems, and water conservation technologies
- adaptive infrastructure and disaster preparedness measures to avoid the effects of climate change and natural disasters

### Challenges and Barriers
1. Financial and Resource Constraints
2. Political and Institutional Barriers

1. Singapore Urban Redevelopment Authority **(URA)**
2. Seoul Metropolitan Government **(SMG)**
3. Greater London Authority **(GLA)**
4. Curitiba Urban Planning Institute **(IPPUC)**
5. Delhi Development Authority **(DDA)**

#### 1. Singapore Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA):
The URA is the national urban planning agency in Singapore, responsible for land use planning, urban design, and development control. their aim is to make Singapore a better city to live, work, and play
They take a long-term approach when planning Singapore's land use, which involves broad strategies, identifying land for various needs and balancing economic, social and environmental needs

##### Key achievements:
1. **Comprehensive land use planning**
    efficient use of land, balanced development, and the preservation of green spaces and heritage areas
2. **Sustainable urban design**
    transit-oriented development, and green infrastructure. creating more livable, climate-resilient neighborhoods.

##### Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)
an urban development approach that focuses on creating compact, mixed-use, and pedestrian-friendly communities around public transportation hubs (metro, bus, and commuter rail stations)

TOD's key principles include:
- Higher-density residential and commercial development
- Placemaking and Community Integration
- Mixed Land Uses
- Pedestrian and Bicycle Friendly
- Reduced Parking Requirements
- Accessibility and Connectivity

One such proposal outside of Singapore is West Edge, a transit oriented development proposed for west Los Angeles, which is designed to act as a neighborhood hub and gathering place.

##### Green Infrastructure
A strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas with environmental features, designed to deliver ecosystem services (improved air quality, recreation, climate adaptation), while also enhancing biodiversity.

Other examples include:
- Urban agriculture
- Green walls
- Urban woodlands
- Suburban and city street trees
- Green roofs
- Sensitive urban design
- Parks, gardens, and golf courses

#### 2. Seoul Metropolitan Government (SMG)

These memories can take shape in different forms such as:
1. Cultural artifacts (Architecture and Civil structures, Art works and Industrial products)
2. Cultural acts and stories (Music, Rituals, Traditions and Techniques)
3. Backgrounds and environments (Markets, Villages, Landscapes, Industrial complexes)
##### Problems with the Current System
Providing owners with incentives rather than encouraging them to preserve cultural heritage leading to modern and contemporary cultural heritage being lost or damaged due to their owners’ lack of understanding on preservation.
##### Principles for Preserving Future Heritage
Citizens should identify the value of preserving heritage, while experts and administrators should present solutions that allow citizens themselves to help with the preservation efforts of Future Heritage. Also spreading the values Future Heritage was based on.

## Sustainable Population Density
---
Sustainable Population Density refers to the optimal number of people living within a given geographic area that can be supported long-term without causing environmental issues or lowering the quality of life for residents.

### Factors for Sustainable Population Density
1. Environmental Factors
2. Infrastructure Capacity
3. Economic Considerations
4. Social and Cultural Factors
5. Governance and Planning Capacity

#### 1. Environmental Factors
- Water availability and quality
- Land use and agricultural productivity
- Energy sources and consumption
- Waste management capacity
- Ecosystem health and biodiversity
- Climate and vulnerability to environmental changes
    environmental changes are caused by climate change, some such changes include:
    - Wildfires caused by heat (Kaibab National Forest, Arizona, United States, 2020)
    - Bleached corals caused by ocean acidification and heating
    - Environmental migration caused by desertification
    - Coastal flooding caused by storms and sea level rise

#### 2. Infrastructure Capacity
- Transportation networks (roads, public transit, etc.)
- Utility infrastructure (water, sewer, electricity, etc.)
- Housing availability and affordability
- Healthcare and social services
- Educational and community facilities
#### 3. Economic Considerations
- Employment opportunities and industry mix
- Cost of living and housing affordability
- Tax base and municipal revenue
#### 4. Social and Cultural Factors
- Access to amenities, recreation, and public spaces
- Diversity, equity, and inclusion
- Public health and safety
- Educational attainment and lifelong learning
- Community cohesion and quality of life
#### 5. Governance and Planning Capacity
- Land use policies and zoning regulations
- Integrated regional/urban planning
- Coordination across jurisdictions
- Citizen engagement and inclusive decision-making

### Strategies for Sustainable Population Density
1. Transit-oriented development (Singapore URA, West Edge)
2. Mixed-use development (The Hub on Causeway in Boston)
3. Green space preservation (Green roofs, Green Infrastructure, Singapore URA)
4. Affordable housing (Housing is considered affordable if a household spends 30% or less of their income to live there.)
5. Smart growth policies (limiting urban sprawl, protecting natural habitats, public transportation)

## Finding a Balance
___
we must find a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of high population density, here are the key factors to consider:
1. **Infrastructure**
    infrastructure like transportation, housing and utilities are essential, without them overcrowding can lead to traffic congestion, pollution, and shortage of resources
2. **Social services**
    Services like healthcare, education and emergency services must be accessible to all members of the community
3. **Environmental Sustainability**
    investing in renewable energy and promoting sustainable practices is necessary to mitigate the effects of high population density
4. **Cultural Diversity**
    multicultural festivals, language programs and community outreach make sure that different cultures are respected within the community
5. **Planning and management**
    the entities in charge must engage with the community, set clear goals and objectives as well as regularly monitor and evaluate progress to preserve the balance

**Setting clear goals can be achieved in 5 steps:**
1. Determine your long-term vision
2. Break down your vision into SMART goals
3. Prioritize your goals
4. Break down goals into actionable objectives
5. track and review your progress regularly

### Case Study: Tokyo, Japan
**Total Population: over 14 million people.**
And yet Tokyo has a well-connected transportation systems and urban planning strategies focusing on compact development and efficiency.

#### Effects of high population density
##### Transportation
Tokyo has been named one of the top 19 cities with the best public transport in the world, *according to data compiled from more than 20,000 respondents in over 50 cities across the globe*
1. The average employee in Tokyo commutes (travels) 90 minutes to work
2. No car can be registered in Tokyo without proof that the owner has a place to park it.
3. Crowded rush hours led to the creation of some of the fastest trains in the world.
4. Parking garages stack cars on top of one another to use less space.
##### Housing
1. The average home in Japan is smaller than in the United States
2. Many Japanese homes do not have separate bedrooms
3. People use rooms for more than one purpose
4. They make things smaller to fit in small spaces
5. They cremate (burn) the dead to save space in cemeteries
##### Land utilization
1. The Japanese build very tall buildings because of limited land.
2. They also make them earthquake resistant.
3. The Japanese grow rice on terraces cut into steep mountainsides.
4. They build underground public spaces, such as shopping malls and museums.
##### Health and the environment
1. Some Japanese wear face masks to avoid making other ill
2. People recycle a lot in Japan to reduce the amount of garbage in dumps
