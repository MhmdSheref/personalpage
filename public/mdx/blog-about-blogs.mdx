I recently came across [a video on the "Indie Web"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTSEr0cRJY8),
and it made me rethink the direction I was taking with my own site. To be honest, it put me in a mid-project identity crisis; I think my website is very cool, yet still I thought to myself: "Man, I would really love to be part of that community. But my website as is wouldn't really fit the vibe."
That developed into a bit of disdain and uncertainty towards this website. Why did I make it? Does it really represent me? Am I just being corporate? These thoughts put me in a sour mood for a bit. Yet I am grateful now that I had them since they led me down a path I might not have explored.

I felt like the best way to begin my search for a renewed purpose was to examine other people's purposes. Why exactly do people make blogs and personal websites? So I spent some time browsing different blogs and reading what the authors had to say.
### Here are some interesting reads I came across:
- [Taking Blogging Seriously](https://tomcritchlow.com/2025/06/27/taking-blogging-seriously/) by Tom Critchlow
- [A blog post is a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting stuff to your inbox](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query) by Henrik Karlsson
- [Why did I build a website?](https://hrothmar.com/blog/why-did-i-build-a-website/) by Hrothmar
- [Why this Website? Five Reasons](https://www.josephdutko.com/why-this-website-five-reasons) by Joseph Dutko
- [Why it took me years to build my own site](https://blog.sharons.site/why-it-took-me-years-to-build-my-own-site/) by Sharon Wang
- [ 'Learning In Public' and 'Digital Gardens'](https://rajrajhans.com/2020/06/thinking-of-blog-as-digital-garden/) by Raj Rajhans

What amazed me was how many different kinds of people were writing blogs. They all had interesting things to share on the same topic; it was like looking at the same picture from different angles and each time seeing something unique.

It also showed me that, to be interesting and sincere, you didn't have to have a website that was out there in terms of design. Designs I saw as "corporate" were still sharing deeply personal and insightful thoughts. I already knew this, but I needed to see it again with my own eyes back then.

*(The idea of a more experimental "Indie Web" website is still on the table, but I don't think it would be a replacement to this one. It'd be just another fun project to work on.)*


The reason I'm writing this post is to act as a personal reminder as to what this is all about, and possibly a beacon for others feeling the same disconnect I felt.

## So really, Why do I write?
I write primarily to create a log of thoughts and ideas that I can always come back to when I need it. But why publicly? In a way, it's how I inform the world of my existence. I'm not exceptional by any means, I don't have vast wisdom, and I'm far from being the best at what I do; yet I think there is meaning in my writing. I might not change the world, but if I can change the life of just one person through this site for the better, I think I will have achieved my goal. (It's also fine if that person is just me.)

Part of me also writes to reach out. I want to connect with people who might be interested in the same things as I am. Other learners and internet surfers who might find my struggles relatable or share the fascinations I have towards certain things. It's within human nature to seek connections. And that pushes me to share more here.

## Who is this for?
I have to admit, a subconscious part of me might have been pressured to make this website because it just seemed like something developers do. As an "Internet portfolio" of sorts, maybe? But the more I thought about it... It's not like an employer will actually care that much about these half formed thoughts of mine.

In reality, this is for me, and maybe for people who already know me, or will someday.

Not much will change after all. I realized I like this website the way it is.
