# Hey!

It seems you've stumbled onto my webpage.\
I'm Mohamed Sheref also known online as "MhmdSheref" or just "Sheref".

In this introduction post I'm going to cover why this page was created, how, and what you can expect in the coming days and years.

## Why are we here?
This website is a project that I've wanted to create for the past 2 years now. And finally, here we are! Over those 2 years I might have not been actively working on it, but my mind kept coming up with ideas that I'd then add to an ever expanding list.\
I also came up with other ideas, applied them, built them, and explored them further. These ideas often lived and died on my pc, only really being shared with the online friends I'm talking to at the time. That's why I wanted to create this website, as a way for me to explore these ideas and share them with the world in my own unique way.\
The reason I decided to make my own website instead of relying on a feed-based social media is twofold
1. I don't like how these platforms seem to always want your attention, their success metrics such as likes and such would be more a distraction than a benefit to me actually getting my ideas out there
2. I have some ideas coming to this site that wouldn't really be applicable, for example, the mind map

## What am I looking at?
### The mind map
The mind map is that thing in the middle of the home website. When I was thinking how I'd convey the thoughts and ideas I'd be sharing on this website, the Idea of the visitors **exploring my mind** really pulled me, so I started thinking...

which led me to this layout, one where each post is represented as a node on this huge tree of connected thoughts *(if you're reading this when it just came out, this would look more like a single dot in a dark ocean to you, if so; sorry, fixing soon trust)*

thankfully someone already did the work of creating a [manipulatable node map in JavaScript ](https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph), so I was able to just use that. The age of the internet rules!

### Blog Preview Pane
This is where you're probably reading from. If you're actually at the bog page, then someone probably shared it to you directly, or you scrolled past this first, only to then regret your shameful action and come back to read it, either way, it's just a side panel that will show you previews of blog posts from now on, since this is the intro post I've opted to leave the full post visible in the preview pane, but most other posts will only show the first paragraph or so.

### Sidebar
It's a sidebar, with the recent releases, I really just want to get to The Lab™

### The Lab™
Yay! I got to The lab™.\
For now, The Lab™ is under construction, but soon The Lab™, accessible from your header, will be an interactive playground where you can try out various different fun experiments and utilities on the web, or even look at and change the code directly to see what happens. It's so far the most exciting part of this website for me, but that changed many times during the website's development, so who knows?

### About me
It's the page to go to if you want to hire me, or contact me for anything else. Actually if you're reading this and I don't already know you, you should reach out! my discord DMs are open, and I'd love to hear what you have to say.


## What to Expect?
I didn't expect to go on a digital tour of my own website, but here we are, I just had to since I really **am** proud of it, like a mother praising her child, a developer must praise his code.\
Tangent aside, if you've read this far you probably already have a grasp of how I like to write, in the near future I plan to release some rapid blogs about projects I've already worked on in the past, and some thoughts I've had and noted down, you can expect The Lab™ to already be incorporated in my work by the time those posts release.

Thanks for reading and stay tuned!
